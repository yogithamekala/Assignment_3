Session Achievements and Individual Contributions
This session focused on enhancing machine learning (ML) and large language model (LLM) components to meet Hack-A-Roo competition standards. Key achievements, individual contributions, and next steps are outlined below, reflecting significant progress in model accuracy, LLM interaction quality, and real-time data flow between components.

Achievements - 
LLM and Skill Prediction Enhancements:
Transformers-Based LLM Integration: Successfully integrated a transformers-based LLM, enhancing skill prediction accuracy by interpreting job titles with natural language processing (NLP). This model upgrade allows for more precise and contextually relevant skill recommendations.
KMeans Clustering Model: Improved the KMeans clustering model to organize skill predictions more effectively by categorizing them into clusters like Python, Data Analysis, etc., improving the relevance and granularity of recommendations.

Twitter Data Analysis and Trends:
Real-Time Tweet Collection: Used the Tweepy API to gather tweets related to HR issues, analyzing them to identify trends such as workplace stress and turnover risk. This contextual data augments the skill prediction model by aligning it with real-world employee trends.
Keyword Extraction for Attrition Monitoring: Analyzed key terms (e.g., “workplace stress,” “turnover risk”) to highlight HR trends, informing the model’s predictions with insights directly relevant to workplace challenges.
Technical Integration and Interface Achievements:
Seamless Backend Integration: Established efficient communication between Flask, MongoDB, and the LLM to handle user inputs, predictions, and data storage reliably. This setup allows for prompt data processing and smooth integration across components.
Real-Time Prediction Display on UI: Developed a user-friendly web interface where users can input job titles and see skill predictions instantly. The interface is interactive, presenting predictions in real-time for a more engaging user experience.

Individual Contributions:
