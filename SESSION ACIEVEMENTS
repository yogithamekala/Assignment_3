Achievements
1. LLM and Skill Prediction:
- Successfully integrated a transformers-based LLM to enhance skill prediction accuracy. The model uses natural language processing to interpret job titles and identify relevant skills, which improves the system’s ability to generate more accurate and contextually relevant predictions.
- Implemented a KMeans clustering model to group job roles with relevant skills, categorizing them into clusters such as Python, Data Analysis, and other technical skills, making the model’s predictions more organized and actionable.

2. Twitter Data Analysis:
- Collected real-time tweets related to HR issues using the Tweepy API and analyzed them to identify trends in workplace challenges, such as employee stress and turnover risks. This information provides valuable context, enhancing the relevance of skill predictions by aligning them with emerging HR and industry trends.
- Extracted and analyzed key keywords from tweets (e.g., “workplace stress,” “turnover risk”) to monitor potential attrition indicators, helping refine the skill prediction model’s insights in line with real-world HR needs.

3. Technical Achievements:
- Established a seamless connection between Flask, MongoDB, and the LLM model to enable reliable data processing and storage. This integration allowed real-time data flow, ensuring that user inputs could be processed promptly and accurately.
- Successfully displayed real-time skill predictions on a user-friendly web interface, allowing users to view outputs instantly and enhancing the overall user experience with smooth and responsive interactions.
