1. Introduction
This project focuses on integrating large language models (LLMs) and machine learning (ML) models into a web-based application for skill prediction and employee attrition analysis. Using a Flask-based interface, the project enables real-time prediction of skills for various job roles. Additionally, insights from employee-related Twitter data provide an understanding of workplace stress and attrition risks.
The project combines:
•	LLMs: To process user inputs for skill prediction.
•	Machine Learning: Clustering skills with KMeans.
•	Twitter Data Analysis: Real-time insights on employee attrition trends.
Task Definition
We identified two core components of the project:
1.	Machine Learning and LLM Integration:
o	Used a KMeans model for clustering job-related skills.
o	Tokenization and text processing performed using Huggingface transformers.
o	Flask-based web interface to interact with the prediction system.
2.	Employee Attrition Data Analysis:
o	Integrated Tweepy API to collect tweets related to employee attrition and stress.
o	Cleaned and pre-processed the tweets for insights into HR-related issues.
Project Goals:
•	Enhance the skill prediction system by improving KMeans clustering.
•	Integrate LLMs to better handle natural language input from users.
•	Collect and analyze Twitter data to extract insights on workplace trends.
