1. Introduction
This project focuses on integrating large language models (LLMs) and machine learning (ML) models into a web-based application for skill prediction and employee attrition analysis. Using a Flask-based interface, the application allows for real-time prediction of skills relevant to specific job roles. Additionally, insights from Twitter data about employee-related trends provide an understanding of workplace stress and potential attrition risks.

Core Technologies:

LLMs: Used for processing user inputs to predict relevant skills.
Machine Learning: Applied KMeans clustering to group skills by job roles.
Twitter Data Analysis: Collected real-time insights on employee attrition and workplace trends.

Project Goals:
Enhance skill prediction accuracy through refined KMeans clustering.
Integrate LLMs to better interpret and respond to natural language inputs.
Collect and analyze Twitter data to provide real-world insights into workplace challenges and trends.

2. Task Definition and Competition-Readiness Goals
Session Focus: This session identified key project components that require enhancement, particularly in ML/DL and LLM areas, to align the project with the Hack-A-Roo competition requirements.

Key Components Requiring Enhancements:
ML/DL Enhancements:
KMeans Model Optimization: Improve clustering accuracy to ensure skill predictions are precise and relevant to the given job roles.
Model Stability and Performance: Enhance backend ML model stability, focusing on optimizing response times and handling increased data volumes for a competition-ready application.

LLM Enhancements:
Improved Text Interaction and Generation: Refine the LLM’s handling of user inputs, especially job titles, to generate more accurate and context-sensitive responses.
Robust Response Generation: Enhance the LLM’s capacity to manage diverse inputs, ensuring consistent and meaningful skill predictions.

Integration Points:
Front-End Visualization: Connect ML models directly to front-end visualizations, enabling users to see real-time predictions that update seamlessly.
Streamlined API Communication: Ensure smooth communication between the front-end UI, LLM, and backend APIs to support a responsive and user-friendly interface.
