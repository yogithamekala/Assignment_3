-- Applying the Model to Your Project

Adaptation to Employee Attrition Risk Analysis
In our ongoing project, the LLM-based sentiment and topic analysis can be adapted to:

Predict Employee Attrition Risk: Apply the sentiment model to internal employee feedback, social media comments, or review platforms like Glassdoor to gauge employee sentiment and identify risk factors for attrition.

Identify Key Workplace Issues: The topic generation model can automatically highlight key themes from employee feedback, such as dissatisfaction with management, work-life balance concerns, or benefits, which could be contributing to attrition.

--Extensions for our Ongoing Project

Sentiment Scoring: Use the sentiment labels to create a sentiment score for each employee review, and aggregate this data to create a "risk score" for departments or teams.

Proactive Measures: If the sentiment is negative, the company could intervene by revising HR policies or increasing support in critical areas.

Comparative Analysis: This model can be extended to compare employee sentiments across different companies or industries to benchmark employee satisfaction and attrition risk.

Predictive skills modelling: We have also implemented KMeans algorithm for detecting the clusters of the skills according to the Job Description fetched using Twitter Api's then used those clusters to predict the skills for the mentioned role of data science related roles or job description.

Conclusion
This project provides a robust framework for analyzing social media or employee feedback using modern LLMs. By leveraging sentiment analysis and topic generation, it helps organizations gain insights into employee morale and identify actionable topics for improvement. With minor adjustments, this approach can be extended to predict employee attrition, analyze customer reviews, or even monitor brand reputation. This approach also includes predicting the skills according to the role of the Job.
